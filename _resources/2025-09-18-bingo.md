Every manager will tell you their policies and arguments come from
their own unique analysis of your particular workplace. But in truth,
the bosses aren’t very creative, and draw from the same few linkedin
influencers for their arguments and ideas. We've put together a bingo card as a
tool to recognize what the same tired talking points are, and to
prepare to answer them. Like any organizing tool, what matters is not
the tool, but the organizing around it, and how it helps you to bring
people together and have discussions to build resolve, solidarity and
confidence. Here's the card, and some ideas how to use it!

## How to play ideas

### Round-Robin
One player is the “boss” and delivers the first talking point (impersonation optional). The next one then formulates a good response. Next, the “worker” becomes the new “boss” and a new “worker” is picked. As you go around, discuss and critique what makes a good response.<br>

### Lightning Round
One player is assigned the boss. They have to make a 60 second elevator pitch in the style of a cringey LinkedIn post of why their company needs to use it. Others play bingo on the whole pitch.<br>
